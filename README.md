**Unveiling Trends in Hospitality Analytics Using Python**

**_Introduction_**

This project focuses on analyzing trends in the hospitality industry using python. By leveraging datasets such as Fact Bookings, Fact Aggregated Bookings, Dim Hotels, Dim Date, and Dim Rooms, the project aims to explore and extract meaningful insights to support business decisions.
The analysis covers a range of tasks, including data exploration, cleaning, transformation, insights generation, and visualization, to uncover hidden patterns and trends in hospitality bookings.

**_Objectives_**

To analyze key metrics like booking frequency, revenue, occupancy rates, and seasonal trends.
To visualize and interpret data for actionable insights in the hospitality sector.

**_Datasets Used_**

1. Fact Bookings:
Contains transactional data about individual bookings.
Key columns: Booking ID, Customer ID, Check-in Date, Check-out Date, Revenue realised, Revenue generated.

2. Fact Aggregated Bookings:
Summarized data about bookings over time or across hotels.
Key columns: Hotel ID, Date, Total Bookings, Revenue realised, Revenue generated.

3. Dim Hotels:
Provides metadata about hotels.
Key columns: Hotel ID, Hotel Name, Location, Rating.

4. Dim Date:
A date dimension table for time-based analysis.
Key columns: Date, Day, Month, Year.

5. Dim Rooms:
Information about room details in each hotel.
Key columns: Room ID, Hotel ID, Room Type.

**_Techniques and Methodology_**

1. Exploration:
Understand the structure of each dataset.
Analyze distributions, grouping, and finding null values.

2. Cleaning:
Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

3. Transformation:
Merge datasets using appropriate keys (e.g., Hotel ID, Room ID).
Generate derived metrics like Occupancy Rate, Revenue Per Available Room.

4. Insights Generation:
Identify peak booking periods and low occupancy trends.
Analyze which hotels, locations, or room types generate the most revenue.

5. Visualization:
Use charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, pie charts) to present findings.
Visualize data in tools like Matplotlib, Pyplot.

**_Technologies and Tools_**

Python Libraries:
Pandas: For Exploration, data cleaning and transformation.
Matplotlib/Pyplot: For visualization.

**_Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)_**

Data aggregation and multidimensional analysis for generating insights.

_**Result**_

The project 'Unveiling Trends in Hospitality Analytics' provides comprehensive insights into the hospitality industry's key trends and patterns. Using the Fact Bookings, Fact Aggregated Bookings, Dim Hotels, Dim Date, and Dim Rooms datasets, and applying techniques such as data cleaning, transformation, insights generation, and visualization, the analysis highlights significant findings that can help businesses improve decision-making.
